# Calculate summary statistics for diving paramaters for each deployment


# Load in deployment data ----



# Load in diving data ----



# Load in dive bout data ----



# **** Make a summary table ----

# First assemble deployment columns ---


# Calculate summaries for various variables -----
# For each get:
# - mean
# - median
# - 95% CI
# - SD


# Number of dives per bout


# Dive depth (maximum)


# Descent and Ascent rates


# Proportion of bottom time during dives


# Output this to new DB table and save R binnary object ----



# Next write plotting script (ggplots of with/ without GPS for different variables)
