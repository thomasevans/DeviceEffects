# Analyse PDI - post-dive interval

# Load data ------

# Load in dive data


# Load in deployment information
# (need to label by device order and device type deployed)


# Look at PDI and dive duration distributions ----
# Histograms of each

# Calculate 0.05, 0.95 % quantiles for dive duration


# Make PDI calculations -----

# For each deployment do:

# For intervals (20 s?) 100 - 250 s?? calculate:
#' PDI min
#' PDI 0.05 quantile
#' PDI 0.10 quantile
#' PDI 0.50 quantile (== median)
#' PDI mean

# Combine above into a single DF together with deployment information
